# Arduino Google Sheet Client Library for Arduino devices


Arduino Google Sheet Client Library for Arduino Devices.


This library works with Google Sheet APIs directly using the Service Account which is safe and reliable as it does not require Google AppScrips and other dirty HTTP hacks to work.
 

Devices will be able to read, update, append and clear sheet values. Creating, reading, listing, and deleting the spreadsheet is also supported.


The spreadsheet created using this library is owned by the Service Account and shared access to the user.


You can create, edit and deploy the Apps Script code via the extension of the spreadsheet created by this library except for running the script due to permission denied.


Spreadsheet created or owned by you needed to share the access with the Service Account's client email then, the library can read and edit except for deleting the user's spreadsheet due to permission denied.


Note: There is a way of hacking to post the data to Google Formsâ€™s linked spreadsheet but it is inefficient and may not work when the form data model changes. 


## Dependencies


This library required the Arduino platforms SDK (for ESP32, ESP8266, Pico, SAMD stm32 and Teensy) to be installed.

To install device SDK, in Arduino IDE, the platform SDK can be installed through **Boards Manager**. 

In PlatformIO IDE, the platform SDK can be installed through **PIO Home** > **Platforms** > **Espressif 8266 or Espressif 32**.


### RP2040 Arduino SDK installation

For Arduino IDE, the Arduino-Pico SDK can be installed from Boards Manager by searching Pico and choosing Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040 to install.

For PlatformIO, the Arduino-Pico SDK can be installed via platformio.ini

```ini
[env:rpipicow]
platform = https://github.com/maxgerhardt/platform-raspberrypi.git
board = rpipicow
framework = arduino
board_build.core = earlephilhower
monitor_speed = 115200
board_build.filesystem_size = 1m
```

See this Arduino-Pico SDK [documentation](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information.




## Prerequisites

This library uses the Service Account credentials to create the short-lived access token for Google API authentication, which will expire in 1 hour and will be refreshed automatically.

You need to create the Service Account private key and enable Google Sheet and Google Drive APIs for your project.

To enable Google Sheet API for your project, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/sheets.googleapis.com

![Create SA](/media/images/API_Enable1.png)

To enable Google Drive API for your project, go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com

![Create SA](/media/images/API_Enable2.png)


In case the spreadsheet that works with this library was created or owned by you, you need to share that spreadsheet with the Service Account client email.

If the spreadsheet is created by this library, it will set the share access to your account automatically, you will get the notification email of the file sharing.


## How to Create Service Account Private Key


Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/iam-admin/settings).

1. Choose or create a project to create a Service Account.

2. Choose Service Accounts

![Select Project](/media/images/GC_Select_Project.png)

3. Click at + CREAT SERVICE ACCOUNT.

![Create SA](/media/images/GC_Create_SA.png)

4. Enter the Service account name, 

5. Service account ID and

6. Click on CREATE AND CONTINUE

![Create SA2](/media/images/GC_Create_SA2.png)

7. Select Role.

8. Click on CONTINUE.

![Create SA3](/media/images/GC_Create_SA3.png)

9. Click on DONE.

![Create SA4](/media/images/GC_Create_SA4.png)

10. Choose a service account that was recently created from the list.

![Create SA5](/media/images/GC_Create_SA5.png)

11. Choose KEYS.

![Create SA6](/media/images/GC_Create_SA6.png)

12. Click ADD KEY and choose Create new key.

![Create SA7](/media/images/GC_Create_SA7.png)

13. Choose JSON for the Key type and click CREATE. 


![Create SA8](/media/images/GC_Create_SA8.png)

14. A private key will be created for this service account and downloaded to your computer, click CLOSE. 


![Create SA9](/media/images/GC_Create_SA9.png)

In the following steps (15-16) for saving the Service Account Credential in flash memory at compile time.

If you want to allow the library to read the Service Account JSON key file directly at run time, skip these steps.

15. Open the .json file that is already downloaded with the text editor.

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "...",
  "private_key_id": "...",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "...",
  "client_id": "...",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "..."
}

```
16. Copy project_id, client_email, private_key_id and private_key from the .json file and paste them to these ```defines``` in the example.

```cpp
#define PROJECT_ID "..." //Taken from "project_id" key in JSON file.
#define CLIENT_EMAIL "..." //Taken from "client_email" key in JSON file.
const char PRIVATE_KEY[] PROGMEM = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"; //Taken from "private_key" key in JSON file.
```

## IDE Configuration for ESP8266 MMU - Adjust the Ratio of ICACHE to IRAM

### Arduino IDE

When you update the ESP8266 Arduino Core SDK to v3.0.0, the memory can be configurable from Arduino IDE board settings.

By default MMU **option 1** was selected, the free Heap can be low and may not be suitable for the SSL client usage in this library.

To increase the Heap, choose the MMU **option 3**, 16KB cache + 48KB IRAM and 2nd Heap (shared).

![Arduino IDE config](/media/images/ArduinoIDE.png)

To use an external Heap from 1 Mbit SRAM 23LC1024, choose the MMU **option 5**, 128K External 23LC1024.

![MMU VM 128K](/media/images/ESP8266_VM.png)

To use an external Heap from PSRAM, choose the MMU **option 6**, 1M External 64 MBit PSRAM.

The connection between SRAM/PSRAM and ESP8266

```
23LC1024/ESP-PSRAM64                ESP8266

CS (Pin 1)                          GPIO15
SCK (Pin 6)                         GPIO14
MOSI (Pin 5)                        GPIO13
MISO (Pin 2)                        GPIO12
/HOLD (Pin 7 on 23LC1024 only)      3V3
Vcc (Pin 8)                         3V3
Vcc (Pin 4)                         GND
```


### PlatformIO IDE

By default, the balanced ratio (32KB cache + 32KB IRAM) configuration is used.

To increase the heap, **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CACHE16_IRAM48_SECHEAP_SHARED** build flag should be assigned in platformio.ini.

```ini
[env:d1_mini]
platform = espressif8266
build_flags = -D PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CACHE16_IRAM48_SECHEAP_SHARED
board = d1_mini
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
```

And to use external Heap from 1 Mbit SRAM 23LC1024 and 64 Mbit PSRAM, **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_EXTERNAL_128K** and **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_EXTERNAL_1024K** build flags should be assigned respectively.

The supported MMU build flags in PlatformIO.

- **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CACHE16_IRAM48**

   16KB cache + 48KB IRAM (IRAM)

- **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CACHE16_IRAM48_SECHEAP_SHARED**

   16KB cache + 48KB IRAM and 2nd Heap (shared)

- **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CACHE16_IRAM32_SECHEAP_NOTSHARED**

   16KB cache + 32KB IRAM + 16KB 2nd Heap (not shared)

- **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_EXTERNAL_128K**

   128K External 23LC1024

- **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_EXTERNAL_1024K**

   1M External 64 MBit PSRAM

- **PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_MMU_CUSTOM**

   Disables default configuration and expects user-specified flags


To use PSRAM/SRAM for internal memory allocation you can config to use it via [**ESP_Google_Sheet_Client_FS_Config.h**](src/ESP_Google_Sheet_Client_FS_Config.h) with this macro.

```cpp
#define ESP_GOOGLE_SHEET_CLIENT_USE_PSRAM
```

   
### Test code for MMU

```cpp

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <umm_malloc/umm_heap_select.h>

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  HeapSelectIram ephemeral;
  Serial.printf("IRAM free: %6d bytes\r\n", ESP.getFreeHeap());
  {
    HeapSelectDram ephemeral;
    Serial.printf("DRAM free: %6d bytes\r\n", ESP.getFreeHeap());
  }

  ESP.setExternalHeap();
  Serial.printf("External free: %d\n", ESP.getFreeHeap());
  ESP.resetHeap();
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}

```


### Use PSRAM on ESP32


To enable PSRAM in ESP32 module with on-board PSRAM chip, in Arduino IDE

![Enable PSRAM in ESP32](/media/images/ESP32-PSRAM.png)


In PlatformIO in VSCode IDE, add the following build_flags in your project's platformio.ini file

```ini
build_flags = -DBOARD_HAS_PSRAM -mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue
```

*When configuring the IDE or adding the build flags to use PSRAM in the ESP32 dev boards that do not have an on-board PSRAM chip, your device will crash (reset).


To use PSRAM for internal memory allocation you can config to use it via [**ESP_Google_Sheet_Client_FS_Config.h**](src/ESP_Google_Sheet_Client_FS_Config.h) with this macro.

```cpp
#define ESP_GOOGLE_SHEET_CLIENT_USE_PSRAM
```

### Usage with TinyGSM
By default, the library assumes a working native WiFi or Ethernet connection. When using TinyGSM as an external client, you most likely do not want to use the Wifi/Ethernet (i.e. to get the current time). You will have to disable this in [**ESP_Google_Sheet_Client_FS_Config.h**](src/ESP_Google_Sheet_Client_FS_Config.h) by uncommenting the following lines like this:
```cpp
/* If not use onboard WiFi */
#define ESP_GOOGLE_SHEET_CLIENT_DISABLE_ONBOARD_WIFI

/* If not use native Ethernet (Ethernet interfaces that are supported by SDK) */
#define ESP_GOOGLE_SHEET_CLIENT_DISABLE_NATIVE_ETHERNET
```
Also, check out the [GSM Example](examples/GSM/GSM.ino) for more information.

**DIMENSION_UNSPECIFIED** The default value, do not use.

**ROWS** Operates on the rows of a sheet.

**COLUMNS** Operates on the columns of a sheet.

param **`valueRenderOption`** (enum string) How values should be represented in the output. 

Note: The default render option is ValueRenderOption.FORMATTED_VALUE.

The whole number portion of the value (left of the decimal) counts the days since December 30th, 1899. 

The fractional portion (right of the decimal) counts the time as a fraction of the day. 

For example, January 1st, 1900 at noon would be 2.5, 2 because it's 2 days after December 30th 1899, and .5 because noon is half a day. 

February 1st, 1900 at 3 pm would be 33.625. This correctly treats the year 1900 as not a leap year.

The default dateTime render option is SERIAL_NUMBER.

**SERIAL_NUMBER** Instructs date, time, datetime, and duration fields to be output as doubles in "serial number" format, as popularized by Lotus 1-2-3. 

The whole number portion of the value (left of the decimal) counts the days since December 30th, 1899. 

The fractional portion (right of the decimal) counts the time as a fraction of the day. 

For example, January 1st, 1900 at noon would be 2.5, 2 because it's 2 days after December 30th 1899, and .5 because noon is half a day. 

February 1st, 1900 at 3 pm would be 33.625. This correctly treats the year 1900 as not a leap year.

**FORMATTED_STRING** Instructs date, time, datetime, and duration fields to be output as strings in their given number format (which is dependent on the spreadsheet locale).

return **`Boolean`** type status indicates the success of the operation.
